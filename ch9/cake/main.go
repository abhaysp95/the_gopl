/** Even when a variable cannot be confined to a single goroutine for its
* entire lifetime, confinement may still be a solution to the problem of
* concurrent access. For example, itâ€™s common to share a variable between
* goroutines in a pipeline by passing its address from one stage to the next
* over a channel. If each stage of the pipeline refrains from accessing the
* variable after sending it to the next stage , then all accesses to the
* variable are sequential. In effect, the variable is confined to one stage of
* the pipeline, then confined to the next, and so on. This discipline is
* sometimes called "serial confinement" */
